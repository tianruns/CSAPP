# Lecture 1
## Theme
Anstraction is good but do not forget reality
## 5 Realitues
1. Ints are not Integers, Float are not Reals
2. Assembly is key to machile/level execution model
3. Memory matters
4. There is more to performance than asymptotic complexity
5. Computer more than execute programs (IO, network communicate)

# Lecture 2 & 3 Bits, Bytes and Integers
## Bit information
1. Either 0 or 1.
2. Easy for electronic implementation
3. 8 bits = 1 Byte
## Bit-level manipulations
### Bit operations
1. AND = &,  OR  = |,  NOT = ~,  XOR = ^
2. Bit-level operations apply to integral data type
3. View arguments as bit vector
4. Apply arguments bit-wise
5. Contrast to logical operations (||, && and !)
### Left Shift operations
Left Shift: x << y -> shift bit-vector x left y positions
1. Throw away extra bits on left
2. Fill with 0's on right
